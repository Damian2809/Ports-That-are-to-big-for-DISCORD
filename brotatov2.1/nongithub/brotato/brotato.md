## Notes

The DLC from Steam are not compatible with the Epic version of the game that is used in this port.
Brotato wont run good on anything lower than a rk3588

Thanks to [Blobfish Games](https://www.blobfish.dev/) for making this wonderful roguelite
Thanks To [Kdog](https://github.com/cdeletre/hacksdl) for his work on HackSDL as this made the port possible
And Thanks to you for playing it
